# Why Machine Learning has been so popular?

* Manually crafting decision rules is feasible for some applications, particularly those in which humans have a good understanding of.
* Using machine learning, howerver, simply presenting a program with a collection of data might be enough.
* Supervised machine learning
    * identifying handwritten digits
    * determining whether a tumor is benign
    * detecting fraudulent activity in credit card transcations
* Unsupervised machine learning
    * indentifying topics in a set of blogs
    * segmenting customers into groups with similar preferences
    * detecting abnormal access patterns to a website
* For both supervised and unsupervised learning problems, it is important to have a representation of your input data that a computer can understand.
* Often it is helpful to think of your data as a table.
    * each entity or row is a sample, while the columns are called features
* No machine learning algorithm can make a prediction on data for which it has no infomation.

* The most important part in the machine learning process is understanding the data you are working with and how it relates to the task you want to solve.
    * What question(s) am I trying to answer?
    * Do I think the data collected can answer the question?
    * How to phrase my question(s) as a ml problem?
    * What features did I have, and will them enable the right predictions?
    * How to measure the success in my applications?
    * How will the ml solution interact with other parts if my research or products?
* In a large context, the algorithms and methods in ml are only one part of a greater process to solve a particular problem, and it's good to keep the big picture in mind at all times.Many people spend a lot of time building complex ml solutions, only to find out they don't solve the right problem.
